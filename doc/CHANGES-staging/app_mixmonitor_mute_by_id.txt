It is now possible to specify the MixMonitorID when calling
the manager action: MixMonitorMute.  This will allow an
individual MixMonitor instance to be muted via ID.

The MixMonitorID can be stored as a channel variable using
the 'i' MixMonitor option and is returned upon creation if
this option is used.

As part of this change, if no MixMonitorID is specified in
the manager action MixMonitorMute, Asterisk will set the mute
flag on all MixMonitor audiohooks on the channel.  Previous
behavior would set the flag on the first MixMonitor audiohook
found.
